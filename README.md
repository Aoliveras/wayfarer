# Technologies

For this project I used a full stack for the first time, I am completely creating an app from the ground up, back-end server side and front-end client side and it was extremely challenging and fullfilling at the same time. 

This app has a User model, a Cities model and a Posts model that use referencing and embedding in order to pass informartion through at appropriate times. 

Node.js with Passport authentication, express, MongoDB, javascript, HTML, CSS, Materialize framework for CSS
